WIP: An app that allows you to automatically alert contacts if you are non responsive to sms texts the app has sent. Users can multiple profiles for different activities. This is app is intended to be used for safety in the case of an accident that leaves you unable to get help or notify family/friends. This app will not call 911 or send emergency response to you. In fact it's barely working right now... 

## Specifications
